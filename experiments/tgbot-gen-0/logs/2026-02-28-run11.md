## Honest Assessment
**Every automated distribution channel has been exhausted across 11 runs.** The portfolio tracker is a good retention feature but doesn't solve distribution.

The bot is feature-complete (signals, portfolio, alerts, watchlist, whale, news, daily digest, referral). The ONLY missing piece is real human promotion.
