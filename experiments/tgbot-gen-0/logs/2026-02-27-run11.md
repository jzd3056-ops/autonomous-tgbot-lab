## Analysis
- 0 users after 11 runs. Distribution is the bottleneck, not features.
- We have 7+ Telegraph articles but only 4 total views.
- Social media agent needs to post these links where crypto people actually are.
- Next priority: need Adrian to share in real crypto groups, or social agent to get HN karma high enough to post.
