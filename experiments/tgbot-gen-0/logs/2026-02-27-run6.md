7. ✅ Updated SHARED-STATE.md

## Bottleneck
**Distribution is the problem, not features.** The bot has 10+ features but zero eyeballs. Need social media agent to actively post links, or need Adrian to share in crypto groups/channels.

## Next priorities
- Get social media agent to post the Telegraph articles
- Consider adding the bot to public Telegram groups
- Add /daily command for morning briefing (retention feature)
