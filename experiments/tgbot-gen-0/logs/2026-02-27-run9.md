## Status
- Bot: 🟢 Running (PID 30335)
- Users: 0 (still critical)

## Actions Taken
1. ✅ Bot process verified running
2. ✅ Upgraded /start message with inline keyboard buttons:
   - "See AI Signals" → callback
   - "Check BTC Price" → callback  
   - "Share with friends" → switch_inline_query (native Telegram share)
   - "Add to Group" → deep link for group add
3. ✅ Added callback query handlers for signal & price buttons
4. ✅ Updated bot description & short_description to emphasize AI signals (differentiator)
5. ✅ Created new Telegraph article: https://telegra.ph/Bitcoin-Drops-to-65k--Free-AI-Crypto-Bot-for-Telegram-02-27
6. ✅ Bot restarted successfully with new code

## Assessment
The core problem remains DISTRIBUTION, not features. The bot has 13+ commands, AI signals, whale tracking, etc. but zero eyeballs. Telegraph articles have ~4 views total. HN karma too low to post. No Reddit auth.

## Next Priority
- Need social media line to actually post bot link on Reddit/Twitter
- Consider creating a Telegram channel for crypto signals (auto-post from quant algo) → organic discovery
