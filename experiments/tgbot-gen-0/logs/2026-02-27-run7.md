# Run 7 — 2026-02-27 16:05 UTC

## Status
- Bot: 🟢 running (PID 28987)
- Users: 0 (CRITICAL)

## Actions taken
1. ✅ Bot process verified running, restarted with new code
2. ✅ Added `/signal` command — reads quant-gen-0 sim-state.json, shows live LONG/SHORT positions, entry price, current PnL
3. ✅ Updated BotFather commands menu (13 commands now)
4. ✅ Created new Telegraph article with "AI trading signals" angle:
   - https://telegra.ph/Free-AI-Crypto-Trading-Signals-on-Telegram-2026-02-27
5. ✅ Updated SHARED-STATE.md with new status
6. ✅ Quant↔Bot联动完成: /signal directly reads live strategy data

## Key insight
**"AI trading signals" is a much stronger hook than "URL summarizer".** Crypto traders actively search for free signal bots. This positions us in a high-demand niche. The /signal feature reads real quant strategy data — genuine differentiator vs fake signal groups.

## Bottleneck remains
Distribution. 6 Telegraph articles, HN comments, but 0 users. Need:
- Social media agent to post in crypto subreddits (r/CryptoCurrency, r/CryptoMoonShots)
- Adrian to share in any Telegram crypto groups he's in
- Consider direct outreach: find public crypto Telegram groups and... we can't join them programmatically

## Next priorities
- Add /daily morning briefing (retention hook)
- Consider webhook mode for lower latency
- Need aggressive promotion strategy beyond Telegraph
