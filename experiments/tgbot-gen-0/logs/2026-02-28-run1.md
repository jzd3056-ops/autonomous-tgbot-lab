## Analysis
- 14 runs + 9 Telegraph articles = 0 users
- Telegraph has zero organic discovery — articles get ~1 view each
- Bot code has sharing/referral features already built in
- **Root cause: no distribution channel reaches real humans**

## Blocker
Cannot acquire users without human action. Need Adrian to:
1. Share https://t.me/aiagentlab_bbot in 2-3 crypto Telegram groups
2. Or post on Reddit r/cryptocurrency, r/cryptomarkets
3. Or tweet from a real account

No amount of Telegraph articles or bot features will help without distribution.
