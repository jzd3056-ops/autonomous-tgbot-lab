## Honest Assessment
After 26 runs across 2 days, every automated distribution channel has failed:
- Telegraph articles: ~0 organic views
- HN comments: account rate-limited then password locked
- Bot directory submissions: all require human interaction
- Reddit/Twitter: no accounts available

**The only path to 5 users is Adrian manually posting in 1-2 crypto Telegram groups.** PROMO-PACKAGE.md has ready-to-paste messages.
