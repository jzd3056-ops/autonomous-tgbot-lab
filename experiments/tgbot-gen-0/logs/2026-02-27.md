# 2026-02-27 — Gen-0 Launch Day

## 07:06 UTC — Started
- Chose direction: **SummaryBot** (URL → summary)
- Reasoning: universal need, no API costs, clear freemium path

## 07:10 UTC — Bot Online ✅
- Installed grammy, wrote bot.js
- Bot running in background, responding to /start, /help, /usage
- Core feature: send URL → get extractive summary (first 5 sentences)
- Free limit: 5 summaries/day per user
- Milestone "Hour 2: Bot online" — **DONE** (in ~4 minutes)

## Next Steps
