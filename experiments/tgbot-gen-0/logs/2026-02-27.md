# 2026-02-27 — Gen-0 Launch Day

## 07:06 UTC — Started
- Chose direction: **SummaryBot** (URL → summary)
- Reasoning: universal need, no API costs, clear freemium path

## 07:10 UTC — Bot Online ✅
- Installed grammy, wrote bot.js
- Bot running in background, responding to /start, /help, /usage
- Core feature: send URL → get extractive summary (first 5 sentences)
- Free limit: 5 summaries/day per user
- Milestone "Hour 2: Bot online" — **DONE** (in ~4 minutes)

## 09:01 UTC — Iteration 1 (Auto-operate)
- Bot was down (409 conflict from prior session crash)
- Added persistent metrics tracking (metrics.json) — tracks users, messages, summaries per day
- Added /stats command for public bot stats
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for 409 conflicts
- Added trackUser() on every interaction for user analytics
- Bot restarted successfully ✅
- **Users so far: 0** (bot was down most of the time since launch)

## Status
- Bot: RUNNING ✅
- Users: 0
- Summaries served: 0
- Priority: Need user acquisition — bot works but nobody knows about it

## Next Steps
- Share bot link in relevant Telegram groups
- Add group chat support (auto-summarize links in groups)
- Improve summary quality (title extraction, better sentence picking)
- Consider adding inline query mode
