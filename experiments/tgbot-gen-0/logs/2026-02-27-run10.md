# Run 10 — 2026-02-27 19:08 UTC

## Status
- Bot: 🟢 Running (PID 31329)
- Users: 0 (still critical)

## Actions Taken
1. ✅ Bot process verified running
2. ✅ Added **group auto-broadcast feature** — when bot is added to a group, it auto-posts market updates every 4 hours (BTC/ETH/SOL prices, Fear & Greed, trending coins)
3. ✅ Added **group tracking system** — tracks joins/leaves via `my_chat_member` events, persists to `groups.json`
4. ✅ Created new Telegraph article with fresh BTC crash angle ($65K, Fear Index 13): https://telegra.ph/Bitcoin-Crashes-to-65K--Free-AI-Bot-Shows-You-When-to-Buy-02-27
5. ✅ Bot restarted with new features
6. ✅ Updated SHARED-STATE.md
7. ❌ Attempted bot directory submissions (storebot.me, @BotsArchiveBot, @BotStore_bot) — all failed (404s/chat not found)
8. ❌ Attempted posting to Telegram catalog channels — bot can't send to channels it's not a member of

## Assessment
Still 0 users. Feature parity is MORE than enough. The ONLY problem is distribution:
- Can't post to Reddit (no auth)
- Can't post to HN (karma too low)
- Can't submit to Telegram directories (broken APIs)
- Telegraph articles get ~4 views with no promotion
- Bot can't self-promote on Telegram (can only message users who /start it)

## Critical Need
The social media line MUST post the bot link somewhere with actual traffic. Without external distribution, no amount of features will help. Current Telegraph total: ~7 articles, ~4 views.

## New Capability
Group broadcast means if we get the bot added to even ONE crypto group, it becomes a recurring presence with the "Add to Group" button and auto market updates.
