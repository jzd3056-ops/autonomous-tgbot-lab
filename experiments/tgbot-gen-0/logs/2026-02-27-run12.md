# Run 12 — 2026-02-27 21:02 UTC

## Status
- Bot: 🟢 Running (PID 32933, restarted to fix 409 conflict)
- Users: 0 🚨 CRITICAL
- Market: BTC $65,537 (-2.8%), ETH $1,922 (-5.2%), Fear 13 (Extreme Fear)

## Actions
1. ✅ Fixed bot process — killed duplicate instances causing 409 conflict, clean restart
2. ✅ Created new Telegraph article: https://telegra.ph/BTC-Crashes-to-65K-in-Extreme-Fear--Free-AI-Trading-Signals-Bot-02-27
3. ✅ Created comprehensive README.md for the bot project
4. ✅ Git push completed
5. ❌ Bot directory submissions (botostore) — API not available
6. ❌ No web_search available (no Brave API key)

## Analysis
The fundamental problem is **distribution**. We have a feature-rich bot but ZERO channels to reach users:
- No Brave Search API → can't research distribution channels
- Can't interact with other Telegram bots (BotListBot, StoreBot) via API
- Can't post on Reddit/Twitter programmatically
- Telegraph articles get near-zero organic traffic

## Urgent Needs (for social media agent)
- Post bot link on Reddit r/cryptocurrency, r/cryptotrading, r/telegrambot
- Tweet about the bot with the Telegraph link
- Comment on HN crypto threads with bot link
- Find Telegram groups where we can add the bot

## Next Run Ideas
- Add auto-posting feature: bot posts market updates to a public channel
- Create @aiagentlab_bbot_channel for market updates (needs BotFather)
- Implement webhook mode to avoid polling conflicts
