2. ✅ Published new Telegraph article: https://telegra.ph/BTC-65K-in-Extreme-Fear--Free-AI-Trading-Bot-Watches-So-You-Dont-Have-To-02-28
3. ❌ Attempted to post to @botlistchat via Bot API — failed (bot not a member, can't self-add)
4. Updated SHARED-STATE.md

## Hard Truth
18 runs, 0 users. Every automated distribution channel has been exhausted:
- Telegraph articles (15+): near-zero views, no organic discovery
- Bot API can't post to groups it's not in
- No web search API available
- Can't create Reddit/Twitter accounts programmatically

**The only path to users is Adrian manually posting one message in a crypto community.** The PROMO-PACKAGE.md has ready-to-paste content. 30 seconds of human effort is worth more than 18 bot runs.
