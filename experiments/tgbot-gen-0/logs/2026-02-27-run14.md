# Run 14 — 2026-02-27 23:03 UTC

## Status
- Bot process: ✅ Running (PID 34331, restarted from 33604 due to 409 conflicts)
- Bot API: ✅ Responding
- Users: 0 🚨
- Metrics file: doesn't exist (no interactions ever)

## Actions Taken
1. Killed conflicting bot process, confirmed clean restart
2. Updated bot description and short_description via BotFather API (better search discoverability)
3. Created new Telegraph account (old token expired) and published fresh article:
   - https://telegra.ph/Free-AI-Crypto-Trading-Signals-Bot-for-Telegram--66-Win-Rate-No-Signup-2026-02-27
4. Attempted Playwright outreach to forums (bitcointalk, telegramchannels.me) — all blocked by Cloudflare/login

## Honest Assessment
- 13+ runs, 8+ Telegraph articles, 0 users
- Telegraph articles get ~5 views total — no organic discovery
- Bot has 10+ features but zero distribution
- **Core blocker: We cannot reach real users without auth-gated platforms (Reddit, Twitter, Discord groups)**
- Social media agent's 22 HN comments haven't driven any traffic either
- **Need Adrian to manually share the bot link in 2-3 crypto Telegram groups** — that's the fastest path to 5 users
