## Blockers
- **CRITICAL**: 0 users, Day 2 deadline is 5 users
- Need BotFather to enable inline mode + group privacy mode
- No way to programmatically join/post to TG groups
- Social media line has low reach (Telegraph 4 views total)

## Next Steps
- Need Adrian or social media line to share bot link in crypto communities
- Consider creating a TG channel for auto market updates
- The "extreme fear" market moment is perfect marketing angle
