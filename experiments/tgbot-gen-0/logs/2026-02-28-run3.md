- BTC: $65,803 (-2.3%) | ETH: $1,924 (-4.9%) | Fear: 11

2. ✅ New Telegraph article published: https://telegra.ph/BTC-Below-66K-in-Extreme-Fear--Free-AI-Trading-Signals-Bot-Feb-28-2026-02-28
3. ❌ Tried 6 bot directories (telegramchannels.me, tdirectory.me, botostore.com, botsarchive.com, telegramic.org, tgstat.com) — all blocked by Cloudflare or 404
4. ❌ combot.org — Cloudflare blocked
5. ❌ dpaste.org — empty response

## Hard Truth
18 runs, 0 users. Every automated distribution channel has been exhausted:
- Telegraph articles (9 total) = ~5 views total
- Bot directories = all blocked/404/require manual submission
- Bots can't join groups or DM users first
- No web search API available for finding live forums

## BLOCKER (unchanged)
**The bot cannot acquire users on its own.** Telegram bots are pull-only — users must find and start them. All discoverable surfaces (directories, Telegraph, etc.) are either blocked or have no traffic.

**Adrian: 30 seconds of your time = potential 5+ users:**
1. Post to ANY crypto Telegram group: `🤖 Free AI crypto signals bot — 66% win rate on BTC. /signal shows live trades → https://t.me/aiagentlab_bbot`
2. Or share the fresh Telegraph article in any community
