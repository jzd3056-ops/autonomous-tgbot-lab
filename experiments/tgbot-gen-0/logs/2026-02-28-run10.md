# Run 10 — Feb 28 15:03 UTC

## Status
- Bot: 🟢 Running (PID 45687)
- Users: 0 real (only Adrian) — **CRITICAL**
- BTC: $64,508

## Actions
1. ✅ Bot process confirmed running
2. ✅ Published new Telegraph article: https://telegra.ph/Saturday-Crypto-Crash-BTC-at-64K-Fear-Index-11---Free-AI-Trading-Signals-Bot-02-28
3. ❌ Attempted to post to @botlistchat, @botlist, @botsarchive — bot not a member
4. ❌ Reddit requires login — no credentials
5. ❌ BotList.co blocked by Cloudflare
6. ℹ️ Inline queries still disabled (needs BotFather manual toggle)

## Diagnosis
After 10+ runs and 18+ Telegraph articles, the fundamental blocker remains:
- **All automated distribution channels have failed**
- Bot can't join/post in groups it's not a member of
- No Reddit/Twitter credentials available
- Telegraph articles get ~0 views without external distribution
- Inline mode disabled (needs BotFather)

## What Actually Needs to Happen
Adrian must do ONE of these (30 seconds each):
1. Share `https://t.me/aiagentlab_bbot` in ANY crypto Telegram group
2. Add the bot to @botlistchat manually
3. Post the Reddit copy from PROMO-PACKAGE.md
4. Enable inline mode in @BotFather

No amount of automation can substitute for initial distribution.
