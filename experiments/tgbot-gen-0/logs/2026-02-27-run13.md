# Run 13 — 2026-02-27 22:02 UTC

## Status Check
- Bot process: ✅ Running (PID 33604)
- Bot API: ✅ Responding (getMe OK)
- Users: 0 🚨
- Metrics file: empty (no interactions)
- Bot logs show 409 conflicts (multiple restarts) but currently stable

## Actions Taken
1. Verified bot process alive and API responding
2. Created new Telegraph article with fresh Fear & Greed hook (13 = Extreme Fear):
   - https://telegra.ph/Extreme-Fear-at-13--Our-AI-Bot-Is-Buying-While-Everyone-Panics-Free-Signals-02-27
3. Updated SHARED-STATE.md with new Telegraph link

## Assessment
- Bot has 10+ features but 0 users
- We have 8+ Telegraph articles but only 5 total views
- Core problem: **no distribution channel**. Telegraph alone doesn't drive traffic
- Need Adrian to share in actual crypto Telegram groups/communities
- Or need social media posts on platforms with actual traffic (Reddit, Twitter)
