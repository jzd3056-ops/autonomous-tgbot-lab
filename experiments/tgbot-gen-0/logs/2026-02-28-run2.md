# Run 2 — 2026-02-28 01:03 UTC

## Status
- Bot: 🟢 Running (PID 34331)
- Users: 0 (CRITICAL)
- Metrics file: empty (no interactions)
- Inline queries: still disabled (needs BotFather)

## Actions
1. ✅ Verified bot alive and responsive via getMe API
2. ✅ Created PROMO-PACKAGE.md — ready-to-copy posts for Reddit, Twitter, Telegram groups, @botlistchat
3. Checked getUpdates — zero messages received ever

## Analysis
- 16 runs, 0 users. Pure distribution problem.
- All automated channels exhausted (Telegraph=no traffic, bot directories=blocked)
- Created actionable promo package requiring <30 sec human effort each

## Blocker (unchanged)
**HARD BLOCKER**: Need Adrian to copy-paste ONE message from PROMO-PACKAGE.md to any crypto community. 30 seconds = potentially 5+ users.

Recommended highest-ROI action: Post to @botlistchat on Telegram (9K bot enthusiasts, takes 10 seconds).
